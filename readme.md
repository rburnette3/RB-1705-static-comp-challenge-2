# Static_comp2_1705

The second static comp of this module is that of a "card-style" layout.  The desktop layout was first developed full for screen display.  The color palette was chosen by using the web application Coolors and was modified to capture but the original colors of the comp as well as a palette that would compliment the theme of snowboarding.  The very top of the page contains the header which is broken into three sections the admin dropdown menu, the navigation bar and the heading title.  Each of these sections is inside a container so that they can be manipulated during responsive design.  The bottom section contains the "card container"  this is where the individual cards are stored.  The property of flex wrap was used to enable an even flow of cars as they are added or the screen size is reduced.  Each card is hard code so that the dimensions and its contents do not change.  Each picture contains a tinted overlay across the top which fades during a mouse over.  This is designed to accent the blue arrow and view count during a dormant phase.  as the screen and device size becomes progressively smaller, the cars collapse on themselves forming columns of four all the way to one card in the mobile view.  The contents of the header also stack on top of each other to form the main menu area of a mobile device.
